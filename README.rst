Building from source
--------------------
First of all, you'll need to install such development packages:

- GTK version 3.4.0 or later
- Glib version 2.32.1 or later
- GDBM version 1.10 or later
- po4a version 0.45 or later
- itstool version 1.2.0 or later
- libayatana-appindicator3 version 0.4.92 or later (optional)
- libgtkspell3 version 3.0.3 or later (optional)
- Meson version 0.37 or later

Next you have to go to directory with program's source code and issue these commands::

    meson build
    cd build
    ninja
    sudo ninja install

If you prefer good old Autotools, you can use these commands instead::

    sh configure
    make
    sudo make install

Program files will be copied into your system directories. It's better to build package and install it though. Packages specification files are available in 'packages' directory of source code tree.
